      <h1> Hooters </h1>
      <div id="mainContent">
      <p> Back in 1983 in Clearwater, Florida, six businessmen with no restaurant experience whatsoever got together to open a place they couldn’t get kicked out of. True story.

         More than three decades later, the Hooters brand has grown into an international sensation, with more than 420 Hooters in 29 countries. How do you say Hooters in all those languages? Here’s a hint. It’s just Hooters.
      </p>
      <p> Since the beginning, we’ve been deeply involved in the communities we serve and continue to increase our commitment to the causes we hold most dear.

         We’re a proud partner of the Jimmy V Foundation for Cancer Research, and also established a Breast Cancer Research Grant in the name of Kelly Jo Dowd—the beloved 1998 Hooters Calendar Cover Girl who spent the last years of her life battling breast cancer. To date, Hooters has raised more than four million dollars to benefit the V Foundation and the fight against breast cancer.
         
         In addition, the Hooters Community Endowment Fund raises money for important local and national charities like the Make-A-Wish Foundation, U.S.O., Special Olympics, American Diabetes Association, Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, and the Muscular Dystrophy Association.
